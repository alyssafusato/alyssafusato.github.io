    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>
        ShotView is a mobile platform for managing Garmin archery and ballistics devices, starting with our upcoming
        radar chronograph. As the sole designer on the project, <strong>I was in charge of bringing the app from a few
            rough concept screens into a fully-realized app experience. </strong>
    </p>

        <div class="label-1">

    </div>
    <p>
        Created to launch alongside the C1 Pro chronograph, the ShotView app needed to allow users to view, edit, and
        export shot data recorded by the C1 device. <strong>
            In the future, ShotView will also have to support many other Garmin archery
            and ballistics products, requiring a highly adaptive and scalable design.
        </strong>

    <h4>What is the C1 Pro Chronograph?</h4>
    <p>
        Chronographs are devices that measure projectile speeds. They are often used by hunters and long-range
        shooters to optimize their gear for peak accuracy and consistency.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most chronographs needed massive shades, a dedicated stand, bulky carrying cases, or
        lengthy calibration procedures. By contrast,
        <strong>
            the Garmin C1 Pro’s ultra compact size and effortless setup
            process made the device unlike anything before it.
        </strong>
    </p>

        <img src="assets/images/chronograph-size-compare.png"
            alt="Illustration of the C1's size compared to other chronographs"></img>
        <div class="label-1">The C1 Pro is small enough to fit in your
            pocket without compromising on accuracy or reliability.</div>
    </div>
    <p>
        Consumer electronics like the C1 Pro will often pair to a mobile app for additional functionality and support.
        I designed the ShotView app to have several additional features to further enhance the C1 experience, but
        they were ultimately shelved in a late-project scope change.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            The app’s main focus shifted to allow users to review, edit, and share the shot data recorded on the C1 Pro.
        </strong>
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h4>A clear & informative review screen</h4>
    <p>
        The review screen for each session needed to show aggregated values for the larger activity along with specific
        metrics for individual shots.
    </p>
    <p>
        I leaned into <strong>visual hierarchy to draw out the most important stats</strong> up front while still
        providing access to
        individual shot details below. Here’s how ShotView’s review screen stacks up to our competitors:
    </p>
    <div class="img-container">
        <img src="assets/images/sv-compare.png"
            alt="Screenshots of ShotView app's review screen next to other apps"></img>
        <div class="label-1">The review screens on other chronograph apps have nearly idential information
            and mainly differ in presentation</div>
    </div>
    <p>
        <strong>
            I built the review screen using modular sections that allow the layout to be easily added onto or rearranged
            to suit our needs.
        </strong>
        This became crucial later into development when features had to be cut for time. Instead of
        being forced to refactor everything, all I needed to do was take a few sections out for launch so they could be
        re-added in a later release.
    </p>

        <div class="label-1">A breakdown of the Session Review screen, which has been organized into modular sections.
        </div>
    </div>
    <h4>Building with future growth in mind</h4>
    <p>
        On top of gradually introducing major feature updates over time, ShotView would need to support upcoming archery
        and ballistics devices with completely different needs and use cases.
    </p>
    <p>
        This required a flexible design that
        <strong>
            could accommodate new features and functionality without completely disrupting the user’s prior experience.
        </strong>
    </p>
    <div class="img-container">

        <div class="label-1">Main tabs have a consistent structure while the device and review pages are tailored to suit the needs of each product.</div>
    </div>
    <p>
        Organizing the app this way means that new archery and ballistics devices can pair to ShotView instead of
        needing an entirely new companion app.
    </p>
    <h4>Adding flexibility to the home screen</h4>
    <p>
        The Home screen is made up of cards and button elements that can adapt to whichever devices are currently paired
        to the app. As ShotView grows, the top section of Home can be used to display insights, analytics, or shortcuts
        to common actions.
    </p>

        <!-- <div class="label-1">Main pages of the app contain a list of subpages to device or session-specific details</div> -->
    </div>
    <p>
        <strong>I designed the session cards on the home screen with new future session types in mind.</strong>
        There are several new types on our roadmap that use this card as a template with adjustments tailored to their
        content.
    </p>

    </div>
    <h4>Bringing app improvements into the device</h4>
    <p>
        Ideally, users would pair the ShotView app and the C1 chronograph for the best possible experience, but
        there are some users who prefer to use the C1 on its own. To accommodate these users,
        <strong>
            I pulled in UI updates to mirror the app's design.
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The C1’s much smaller screen size, limited fonts, and black-and-white pixel display meant that UI elements had
        to be adjusted in order to work. Below are some changes that make it
        <strong>
            easier to identify sessions at a glance and help reduce the amount of button presses
        </strong>
        needed to see relevant information.

        <div class="label-1">These improvements help reduce cognitive load when the user is browsing recent
            sessions on the device.</div>
    </div>
    <h4>Feedback-driven additions</h4>
    <p>
        There were a few new suggestions for improvements that I investigated and implemented after launch. One of them
        was the ability to bulk select sessions for export, which was a major perk for users who were recording lots of
        sessions and wanted to share them for further analysis.

    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>
        The C1 Pro and ShotView released together on October 19, 2023 to great success, prompting the C1 to go
        out of stock for months afterward.

    <div class="img-container img-smaller">
        <img src="assets/images/xero-sold-out.png" alt=""></img>
        <div class="label-1">
            Garmin’s sales team had underestimated the units needed by about tenfold, eliciting this reaction
            from a user on a popular rifle sports forum.
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>
        While external limitations prevented the team from implementing everything that had been planned, the
        need to adapt rapidly within those constraints helped me rethink the way I approach design projects.
        Serving as the UX lead on this product taught me to trust my intuition as a designer, and it was
        satisfying to see the tangible results of the whole team's contributions.
    </p>
    <p>
        ShotView was a rare opportunity for me to design an app from the ground up and experience all
        of the ups and downs associated with the full process. I'm proud of have been a part of the project and am
        excited to see where it goes in the future.
