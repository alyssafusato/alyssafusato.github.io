                    Worked with a product manager, mobile software, and consumer electronics software to
                    define requirements, identify opportunities for improvement, concept and design mockups, 
                    establish a handoff process, and create a plan for the app's future growth.

        Garmin's Xero product family has been making waves in the hunting, archery, and rifle sports scene since its
        debut in 2018. I joined the Xero product team as they were working on a slate of exciting new products and their
        mobile counterparts.
    </p>
    <p>
        Of these, the most highly anticipated was the C1 Pro radar chronograph. While the product team had full
        confidence in the device, its companion app ShotView needed a complete overhaul.
    </p>

    <h4>Background</h4>
    <p>
        Chronographs are devices that measure projectile speeds. They are often used by hunters and long-range
        shooters to optimize their gear for peak accuracy and consistency. Most higher-end chronographs come
        with apps that allow users to easily review, edit, and share their shot data.
    </p>
    <p>
        While chronographs all basically do the same thing, the C1 Pro’s standout feature is its compact size and simple
        setup process.
    </p>
    <div class="img-container img-smaller">
        <img src="assets/images/chronograph-sizing.png" alt=""></img>
        <div class="label-1">Unlike its competitors at the time, the C1 Pro was small enough to fit in your
            pocket without compromising on accuracy or reliability.</div>
    </div>
    <p>
        We envisioned ShotView as the central hub for all future shooting and archery-related products at
        Garmin. But in the near-term, its main purpose would be to give shooters a way to view and manage shot
        data recorded on the C1 Pro.
    </p>

    <h4>Design</h4>
    <p>
        We started by designing all of the exciting interactions first. This came back to bite us when half of them had
        to be shelved so we could launch on time. The decision had been made fairly late into the project and required
        revisions to most of the app to account for the loss of key features, but gave us a roadmap for future updates
        and releases.
    </p>
    <p>
        ShotView’s objectives pivoted to presenting shot stats in a way that would still be informative and
        insightful for users. The result is a minimalistic app with a strong emphasis on visual hierarchy to
        showcase session data. 
    </p>

        <div class="label-1">ShotView’s Home and Session pages</div>
    </div>
    <p>
        A simplified map of ShotView's main screens is diagrammed below. The app's shallow, modular architecture
        serves as a scalable base so new features can easily be added in, whether for other ballistics devices
        or new chronograph features.
    </p>
    <div class="img-container">

        <!-- <div class="label-1">Several different iterations of the main data section</div> -->
    </div>
    <p>
        Ideally, users would pair the ShotView app and the C1 chronograph for the best possible experience, but
        there are some users who prefer to use the C1 on its own. To accommodate these users, I pulled in UI
        updates to mirror the app's design.
    </p>
    <p>
        In some cases, this was challenging because of the device’s much smaller screen size and low resolution
        black-and-white display. Sample changes are displayed below.

        <div class="label-1">These improvements help reduce cognitive load when the user is browsing saved
            sessions on the device.</div>
    </div>
    <p>
        There were a few new suggestions for improvements that were investigated and implemented after launch.
        One of them was the addition of bulk exports for sessions, which was a major perk for users who were
        recording lots of sessions and wanted to share them with other platforms for further analysis.

    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>
        The C1 Pro and ShotView released together on October 19 2023 to great success, prompting the C1 to go
        out of stock for months afterward.

            Garmin’s sales team had underestimated the units needed by about tenfold, eliciting this reaction
            from user @giumau1 on the Sniper’s Hide forum.

        While external limitations prevented the team from implementing everything that had been planned, the
        need to adapt rapidly within those constraints helped me rethink the way I approach design projects.
        Serving as the UX lead on this product taught me to trust my intuition as a designer, and it was
        satisfying to see the tangible results of the whole team's contributions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Overall, ShotView was a rare opportunity for me to design an app from the ground up and experience all
        of the ups and downs associated with the full process. I'm proud of have been a part of the project and am
        excited to see where it goes in the future.
