        Garmin Connect is the central app that syncs to our vast range of fitness and wellness products. It serves
        millions of users every day and boasts thousands of positive app store reviews.
    </p>
    <p>
        Back in 2022, Connect was undergoing a lot of change. As part of the team that designs the devices that pair to
        Connect, we wanted to take this opportunity to push for new features that make the most of the app’s ties to our
        wearables.
    </p>

    <!-- <h4>Background</h4> -->
    <p>
        I came up with the idea for Live Activity while working on a larger project to help users
        understand the many performance scores recorded by our devices and present them in new and interesting ways.
    </p>
    <p>
        The problem was that we had a lot of advanced features and insights to show users, but weren’t providing
        explanations for them in a readily accessible manner- users had to go out of their way to learn about them,
        which often meant they didn’t.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most of the work I did went into visualizing these advanced stats, providing explanations about their meaning,
        and reorganizing the app to better accommodate them. We also designed tools to help users analyze and compare
        specific metrics over time, which is currently difficult to do.
    </p>
    <div class="img-container img-smaller">
        <img src="assets/images/wearables-screen-size.png" alt=""></img>
        <div class="label-1">This kind of thing happened way more often than it should have (which is never)</div>
    </div>
    <p>
        At some point, I realized that a major problem with displaying these stats and trends was that users simply
        weren’t recording some of the details we’d need for the feature to work. On activities like Strength, users
        often didn’t bother to add critical details like reps, weight, and the exercises they were doing- both because
        the app didn’t do anything interesting with it, and because it was hard to do.
    </p>
    <p>
        The other features I had concepted helped with the “interesting” part. But we needed to make it easy for users
        to track and update activity details, or they were going to do it somewhere else.
    </p>
    <p>
        My immediate thought was to improve our workout editor and make it easier to edit activities after they’d been
        saved. This would be good, but something told me we could do better.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
        As a part of research for this project, I began spending a lot more time in the gym with other fitness apps. It
        felt much more natural to use my phone to track my strength workouts than my watch, especially since weight
        training has regular breaks for me to open an app and update my workout. The larger screen was great for seeing
        multiple exercises at once, looking up references for the moves I wanted to try, and making changes as I went.
    </p>
    <p>
        I was likelier to keep an accurate log of my activity when I did it on my phone compared to my watch. If only we
        could detect when a user started a strength activity on their watch and allow them to add details on the app in
        real time!
    </p>
    <p>
        On a similar note, during treadmill runs I started to notice that I preferred to use the treadmill’s display to
        keep track of my distance rather than my wearable. Even though the treadmill was worse at accurately tracking
        metrics like heartrate and calories, it was way easier to look at and felt less intrusive to my running
        experience.
    </p>
    <p>
        Many treadmills also have a little built-in place to display your phone as you run. My guess is that it’s for
        watching videos or whatever so you momentarily forget that you’re running. If only we could funnel all of the
        activity data we record from the watch onto somewhere easier to see, like your phone...
    </p>
    <p>
        At the same time, I was working on a different mobile project that relied on a “live” connection to one of our
        devices to control it remotely and display data, so I knew that we had the technology to make it happen. With
        all of that in place, it was time to start designing.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>I wanted the live activity feature to do a few things:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mirror the activity data being recorded on your watch</li>
        <li>Allow users to add rep/weight/move info to strength workouts as they go</li>
        <li>Display video references for strength and yoga moves (which we already have on Connect) in real time</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Here are the two concept screens I made for the pitch deck.
    </p>
    <div class="img-container img-smaller">
        <img src="assets/images/wearables-screen-size.png" alt=""></img>
        <div class="label-1">This kind of thing happened way more often than it should have (which is never)</div>
    </div>
    <p>
        After presenting my work to the VPs in charge of Connect, Fitness, and Outdoor, Live Activity was immediately
        picked up as a feature to be included in Connect’s first subscription launch, Garmin Connect+.
    </p>
    <p>
        The mockups were handed off to a designer who works on Connect, who refined them into their current
        implementation.
    </p>
    <div class="img-container img-smaller">
        <img src="assets/images/wearables-screen-size.png" alt=""></img>
        <div class="label-1">This kind of thing happened way more often than it should have (which is never)</div>
    </div>
    <p>
        The other data analysis recommendations I pitched didn’t make it on the Connect mobile app, but Connect web
        later launched a subscription feature called Performance Dashboard that heavily resembles the chart overlays and
        metric tracking in my presentation and serves the same purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
        Following launch, our analytics showed that Live Activity was widely used despite being limited to specific
        wearables and activity types.
