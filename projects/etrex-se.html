        Garmin's eTrex product line is known for being a reliable entry-level GPS with incredible battery life. Last
        updated in 2011, the device needed new hardware and a visual refresh to adapt it to the modern landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
        This was the first product I was fully responsible for and served as a major learning experience that taught me
        many of the technical, organizational, and collaborative skills I would need to tackle future projects.
        Through it, I had to adapt to a new design environment with vastly different technological constraints and be
        proactive in identifying areas for improvement while coming up with functional solutions.

    <h4>Background</h4>
    <p>
        Despite the widespread availability of navigation apps, Garmin's handheld GPS devices occupy a niche aimed at
        users who need a reliable, rugged navigator with enough battery life to last throughout their adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
        Without the ability to display maps, the main purpose of the eTrex is to display your location with a breadcrumb
        trail of where you've been. This tracking feature provides users with a way back in case they get lost.
    </p>

        <div class="label-1">The eTrex 10 has been known to survive falls down mountains, ski slopes, and rivers.</div>
    </div>
    <p>
        In the years since its release, the eTrex 10 established itself as Garmin's bestselling outdoor handheld. Due to
        its durability, small size, and entry-level price, it became hugely popular among geocachers and hikers.
    </p>

    <h4>Problem</h4>
    <p>
        For the newest iteration of the eTrex, a business-level decision had been made to cut the number of button
        inputs in half to improve its longevity and reduce manufacturing costs.
    </p>
    <div class="img-container">
        <img src="assets/images/etrex-button-compare.png" alt=""></img>
        <div class="label-1">Without the thumbstick, users needed a whole new way to interact with the device.</div>
    </div>
    <p>
        This required a complete redesign of the interface, which we saw as an opportunity to update the product for a
        new generation of adventurers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our next biggest priority was to consolidate the eTrex 10’s large and unwieldy menu structure, which often
        forced users to go back and forth between various apps. It was a recurring complaint on the previous eTrex,
        especially since there were so many apps to choose from that were not always helpful or relevant to users.
    </p>

    <hr>
    <h4>Design</h4>
    <p>
        To make up for the reduced inputs, we had to make the most of each button. By being very intentional about each
        screen's layout we found ways to repurpose the "OK" button to serve multiple functions based on context.
    </p>
    <p>
        One example is the menu, which used to have a dedicated button on the eTrex 10. When “OK” is used to open the
        menu instead of its usual action, we show a special indicator in the corner- right next to where the OK button
        is physically located on the device.
    </p>
    <p>
        This affordance has the added benefit of making it easier to tell when you have extra actions to choose from on
        a given page.
    </p>
    <div class="img-container img-smaller">
        <img src="assets/images/etrex-menu.png" alt=""></img>
        <div class="label-1">On the 10, there is no way to tell if a screen has menu options- you have to press the Menu
            button to find out. On the SE, additional options are indicated by the top right Menu icon.</div>
    </div>
    <p>
        The eTrex 10’s structure resembled a toolbox with an array of discrete tools that were to be used individually
        as needed. This led to a lot of back-and-forth between pages and menus, since features that seemed related were
        sometimes located in completely different apps. It also put critical features on the same level as extremely
        niche ones, which was especially confusing for new users.
    </p>
    <p>
        In response, we consolidated the most important features and grouped them into a single “Tracking” app that
        appears at the top of your list. This will be where the user spends the most time, and reduces the need to jump
        between various other apps.
    </p>
    <div class="img-container">
        <img src="assets/images/architecture-compare.png" alt=""></img>
        <div class="label-1">In contrast to the flat, directionless structure of the eTrex 10 (left), we grouped related
            features together to provide a more guided experience on the eTrex SE (right).</div>
    </div>
    <p>
        As I worked on the eTrex, something that kept bothering me was the vast emptiness of the “map” screen. It felt
        extremely blank and aimless for one of our most important pages, especially as a part of a navigation and
        wayfinding device.
    </p>
    <p>
        I brainstormed several solutions and pitched the map grid to the team. The gridlines would appear in the
        background to help create a sense of scale and direction in an otherwise contextless space. Originally the grid
        was square and matched the size of the scale bar, but we had to make a few compromises due to technical
        constraints.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once we got to see a prototype of the grid in action, the team immediately wanted it for all of our non-mapping
        products moving forward.

    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>
        We launched the eTrex SE on March 14, 2023 with the UX completed several months prior. This was followed up with
        the eTrex Solar, a solar-powered variant of the device with infinite battery life in sunny conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
        In total, I created over 40 flows to cover both products and built more than 330 components in the process.
    </p>

        <img src="assets/images/all-mockups-etrex.png" alt=""></img>
        <div class="label-1">Due to differences in display types and screen resolutions, it’s difficult to make a core
            library for our handheld electronics. I learned a lot about building components as a result!</div>
    </div>
    <p>
        If there was one thing I'd like to do differently next time, it'd be more testing and external validation of the
        designs. We didn't have the resources or infrastructure to conduct testing as a part of our process back then,
        but I think it could've helped us make more informed design choices and discover areas of improvement earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
        Overall, I really enjoyed working on the SE and am looking forward to seeing how users engage with it over the
        years. The device is like a small system unto itself, and being in charge of designing all of it was a fun and
        interesting challenge. While the experience may not seem as relevant to places focused on building apps and
        websites, it gave me the chance to make mistakes and gain skills that I carry with me to this day.
