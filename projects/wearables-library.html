        Wearables are a major part of Garmin’s product portfolio, boasting 6+ regularly updated product families and
        making up nearly 40% of the company’s

            multi-billion dollar revenue stream</a>.
    </p>
    <p>When I first joined Garmin, each wearable had its own dedicated product designer who handled everything for it.
        As wearables grew, the team pivoted to a centralized feature-based approach to create a more cohesive experience
        within our ecosystem.</p>
    <p>Designers were now in charge of features rather than individual devices. Their designs had to account for
        multiple unfamiliar device types with completely different inputs and screen sizes. Compounded by a chronic lack
        of UX documentation, new and experienced designers alike struggled to keep up with the new system.
    </p>
    <p>I was brought in to build a wireframing library that would span multiple product families and help Wearables move
        faster. Having only built a few small libraries for myself up until that point, this challenge would be a huge
        leap into uncharted territory.</p>
    <hr>
    <!-- <h4>Background</h4> -->
    <p>I began by studying other design systems and learning more about the Wearable team’s day-to-day pain points. </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Each designer had to figure out how to build common elements and interactions on their own.</strong>
            This
            made mocking up simple screens and flows extremely time-consuming and laborious. As a result...
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Designers often resorted to using time-saving shortcuts.</strong> <br> Strategies included using
            edited
            screenshots, copying elements from related projects, and creating their own ad-hoc components.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>This had several cascading effects.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Outdated design patterns quickly circulated and were difficult to track down and validate.</li>
        <li>Converting features between product lines (a very common task) took an inordinate amount of time to do.</li>
        <li>
            Major differences in the way designers created deliverables (fonts, screen size, fidelity,
            structure) made collaboration and handoff much more challenging.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="img-container img-smaller">
        <img src="assets/images/wearables-screen-size.png" alt=""></img>
        <div class="label-1">This kind of thing happened way more often than it should have (which is never)</div>
    </div>
    <p>
        Despite the situation, there was also a lot of anxiety about how having a library could change the
        team’s workflow. The biggest worry was around losing creative freedom and limiting innovation, which design
        systems are often criticized for. These fears have prevented us from investing in design systems in the past,
        and we wanted to be mindful of them moving forward.
    </p>
    <p>From this phase, a set of requirements for the library emerged:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Support the main product families owned by the wearables team and make it easy to convert features
            between them</li>
        <li>Find ways for the library to provide guidance without being too restrictive</li>
        <li>Establish a regular update rhythm to stay up-to-date and actively engage with requests and feedback</li>
        <li>Include a process for auditing arbitrary differences and other weirdness</li>
    </ol>
    <hr>
    <p>
        We set up a system to handle component requests and met with the wearables team weekly to discuss them. To keep
        things moving, we kept the process light and prioritized iteration over perfection.
    </p>
    <div class="img-container">
        <img src="assets/images/wearables-library-process.png" alt=""></img>
        <!-- <div class="label-1"> // Diagram of our process // </div> -->
    </div>
    <p>
        It didn’t take long for me to realize that the mockups and design specs linked in each ticket didn’t always
        match implementation. I started keeping a record of device screenshots to show the design team and help with
        auditing. Through it, we caught several bugs and implementation errors to discuss with software. The compiled
        and organized screenshots also began to gain traction as an overview of the device for designers to reference.

    </div>
    <p>
        To feasibly build a single library to cover several product families, we decided go mid-fi and only include the
        details needed to make UX decisions. Out of the many product families and variations Garmin offers, we defined
        <strong>four basic wearable types</strong> that capture all of the products we needed. These would be designed
        at a similar screen size to make conversions between types faster and easier.
    </p>

        <div class="label-1">The basic device types and the products they cover </div>
    </div>
    <p>
        We started with our most common interface element- list items. List items are notoriously complex with many
        different use cases and variations, so we used nested “building block” components to help split them into
        manageable pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since building blocks are controlled by instance swaps rather than variants, users would also be able to create
        entirely new kinds of secondary content or left/right elements and switch them in without breaking the original
        component. This gave us an incredibly flexible base that designers would have room to experiment with.
    </p>

    <div class="img-container">

        <div class="label-1">List items are built using modular pieces that can be swapped out</div>
    </div>
    <p>
        Our approach was great at providing options and possibilities, but lacked direction. We also wanted to give
        users an easy path to the most common versions of an element, which is what they want 99% of the time anyway.
        This would be especially important to avoid overwhelming newer designers still getting the hang of our
        ecosystem.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is where patterns, galleries, and templates come in.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Patterns act like presets for the most common variations</strong> of a base component, while
        <strong>galleries showcase all of the possible permutations</strong> supported by the component. Templates give
        designers a jump start on mocking up common interactions and demonstrate how the component should be used in
        context.

        <div class="label-1">Patterns, galleries, and templates are published alongside the base component to help

    <p>
        Nailing findability was personal to me.

    </p>
    <p>
        There have been many times I’ve tried to search for something in a library, assumed it wasn’t supported, only to
        later learn it was- just under a name/category I didn’t think to try and never would have guessed.

    </p>
    <p>
        Wearables lack standardized naming conventions for most UI elements, which makes it extra difficult to search
        for things by name. We looked into how naming works on software and learned that it’s also somewhat inconsistent
        there and would map poorly to our mental model of the device.

    </p>
    <p>
        Our solution was to lean on visual search. We created a top-level page in the library that aggregates all of the
        supported templates and major screens on the device called the Component Gallery.
    </p>
    <div class="img-container">
        <img src="assets/images/component-gallery.png" alt=""></img>
        <div class="label-1">Previewing everything in the library on one page is doable for wearables since each screen
            is pretty small</div>
    </div>
    <p>
        The Component Gallery allows users to browse all of the screens we’ve built in one place without having to use
        Figma’s Asset Search or dig through individual library pages. This page also makes it easier for designers to
        see which components are already built and what still needs to be requested before opening a new ticket.

        The Wearables Library made its official debut in early 2024 and only grew from there. Within a year, we had
        built
        220 components with over 200,000 recorded inserts by 25 teams around the globe.

        Numbers aside, part of what made working on this project so fun and rewarding was being able to see its impact
        on the wearables team.
