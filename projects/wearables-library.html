                            screenshots, or created their own components, resulting in <strong>frequent inconsistencies

                    <p>
                        Due to the unique needs of the wearables ecosystem compared to something more standardized like
                        mobile or web, we were also working with a completely foreign set of parameters and
                        considerations.

                    <p>
                        To ensure the kit’s success, we developed several key principles to keep us grounded as we began
                        building.
