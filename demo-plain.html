                Wearables are a major part of Garmin’s product portfolio, boasting 6+ regularly updated product families
                and making up nearly 40% of the company’s <a

            <p>
                When I first joined Garmin, each wearable had its own dedicated product designer who handled everything
                for it.
                As wearables grew, the team pivoted to a centralized feature-based approach to create a more cohesive
                experience
                within our ecosystem.
            </p>
            <p>
                Designers were now in charge of features rather than individual devices. Their designs had to account
                for
                multiple unfamiliar device types with completely different inputs and screen sizes. Compounded by a
                chronic lack
                of UX documentation, new and experienced designers alike struggled to keep up as launch dates remained
                in place.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was brought in to build a library that would span multiple product families and help the wearables
                team adapt to the new system. Having only built a few small libraries for myself up until then, this was
                a new and exciting challenge.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>
                I began by studying other design systems and learning more about the Wearable team’s day-to-day pain
                points.
                The core issues boiled down to two things.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Each designer had to figure out how to build common elements and interactions on their own. This
                    made
                    mocking up
                    simple screens and flows extremely time-consuming and laborious. As a result...
                </li>
                <li>
                    Designers often resorted to using time-saving shortcuts. Strategies included using edited
                    screenshots,
                    copying
                    elements from related projects, and creating their own ad-hoc components.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>This had several cascading effects.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Outdated design patterns quickly circulated and were difficult to track down and validate.</li>
                <li>Converting features between product lines (a very common task) took an inordinate amount of time to
                    do.</li>
                <li>
                    Major differences in the way designers created deliverables (fonts, screen size, fidelity,
                    structure) made
                    collaboration and handoff much more challenging.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="img-container img-smaller">
                <img src="assets/images/wearables-screen-size.png" alt=""></img>
                <div class="label-1">This kind of thing happened way more often than it should have (which is never)
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                Despite the situation, there was also a lot of anxiety about how having a library could change the
                team’s
                workflow. The biggest worry was around losing creative freedom and limiting innovation, which design
                systems are
                often criticized for. These fears have prevented us from investing in design systems in the past, and we
                wanted
                to be mindful of them moving forward.
            </p>
            <p>From this phase, a set of requirements for the library emerged:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Support the main product families owned by the wearables team and make it easy to convert features
                    between
                    them</li>
                <li>Find ways for the library to provide guidance without being too restrictive</li>
                <li>Establish a regular update rhythm to stay up-to-date and actively engage with requests and feedback
                </li>
                <li>Include a process for auditing arbitrary differences and other weirdness</li>
            </ol>
            <hr>
            <p>
                We set up a system to handle component requests and met with the wearables team weekly to discuss them.
                To keep
                things moving, we kept the process light and prioritized iteration over perfection.
            </p>
