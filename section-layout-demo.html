                            Okay okay. Here's the situation: <br>
                            I need a site structure that is going to allow for a lot of customizability WITHOUT ALSO
                            being a recipe for me forgetting how it works and blowing it all up/starting over every time
                            I need to update.
                        </h5>

                        <p>
                            Honestly I think the slide layout thing seems to work pretty well, the problem is that the
                            different layout types end up requiring a lot of nested divs and classes to work.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I was initially thinking that I could use YAML to store a bulk of the actual content (text,
                            images, etc) but I'm rather 50/50 on if that'll even work and whether it will be fun to
                            edit.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another thought was to basically re-create Confluence's janky-ass section builder which
                            provides a basic UI for inputting the information (text, object type, image path) where I
                            can pick a layout, input the content I want on a sane interface (rather than writing
                            paragraphs in YAML or the HTML page directly) and have it spit out the proper HTML.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            allat sounds like a ton of work though, I might just need to prioritize completion over something scalable for a system only I will ever use... and only twice a decade, at that.
